# Diagnostics

For the MVP, use the native command surface first. For debugging lossless-claw behavior or failures, inspect the independent Lossless log before the shared OpenClaw gateway log.

## Fast path

### `lcm` shell CLI

Use the packaged shell CLI for bounded, structured database inspection outside an OpenClaw conversation:

```bash
lcm status --pretty
lcm conversations show --session-key 'agent:main:example'
lcm messages tail --conversation-id 42
lcm summaries list --conversation-id 42 --depth 0 --recency 7d
```

JSON is the default output. List commands return opaque keyset cursors. Database commands open `lcm.db` read-only and do not run migrations, repair, cleanup, compaction, or other write operations. `lcm config set` is the only state-changing shell command and edits one manifest-validated Lossless config path with a timestamped backup.

Path overrides use `--db`, `LCM_DATABASE_PATH`, `--openclaw-dir`, `LCM_OPENCLAW_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_HOME`, `--config`, and `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`. See `docs/cli.md` in the package for precedence and the complete command contract.

### Independent Lossless log

Check this first when lossless-claw needs to debug itself, because routine `[lcm]` info and debug lines are written here instead of the shared OpenClaw gateway log.

Default path:

```bash
/tmp/openclaw/lossless-claw-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

For today's local log, use:

```bash
tail -n 200 "/tmp/openclaw/lossless-claw-$(date +%F).log"
```

Useful patterns:

```bash
rg -n "\\[lcm\\] (auto-rotate|rotate|runtime\\.llm\\.complete|summary|compact|assembly)" /tmp/openclaw/lossless-claw-*.log
rg -n "warn|error|failed|truncated|deterministic|fallback" /tmp/openclaw/lossless-claw-*.log
```

The dated default log rolls over daily. Dated files are pruned after 3 days, and oversized active logs rotate through `.1.log` to `.5.log`. Startup banners and warning/error lines are also sent to OpenClaw's runtime logger, so check `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` after the Lossless log when you need gateway-level startup or failure context.

### `/lossless` (`/lcm` alias)

Use this when you need a quick health snapshot.

It should answer:

- Is `lossless-claw` enabled?
- Is it selected as the context engine?
- Which DB is active?
- Is the DB growing as expected?
- Are summaries present?
- Are broken or truncated summaries present?

### `/lossless doctor`

Use this when summary corruption or truncation is suspected.

It is the single user-facing diagnostic entrypoint for summary-health issues in the MVP.

What it should help confirm:

- whether broken summaries exist
- whether truncation markers exist
- which conversations are affected most

### `/lossless maintenance`

Use this read-only command when deferred compaction debt may have outlived an active runtime conversation. It groups pending rows by active/inactive state and reason, and shows a bounded set of inactive conversation examples. The scan does not run migrations, compaction, cleanup, or any other write.

Use the single-target workflow rather than attempting a global sweep:

1. Run `/lossless maintenance` and identify an inactive conversation id.
2. Run `/lossless maintenance drain <conversation-id>` for a no-write preview.
3. Verify the displayed target is inactive and the pending reason is expected.
4. Run `/lossless maintenance drain <conversation-id> confirm-offline`.

The confirmed drain queues on the conversation's stable session identity and rechecks inactivity after acquiring that queue. It refuses an active target, including one that became active while waiting. For an eligible target, Lossless Claw creates a timestamped SQLite backup and then converges deferred compaction directly from durable message rows without reading a transcript file. This explicit offline path makes the normally protected fresh tail eligible for summarization and configured condensation, but retains every raw message row.

A missing conversation or a conversation with no pending debt is a non-mutating result. Backup or SQLite lock failure prevents compaction from starting. Summarizer failure or incomplete convergence keeps `pending=1` and reports the failure instead of claiming success. A second drain after successful convergence is an idempotent no-op.

### `/lossless doctor apply`

Use this only after `/lossless doctor` identifies broken summaries. The command rewrites affected summary content in place after creating a database backup.

- `/lossless doctor apply` repairs the current conversation and keeps the normal large/hot safety preflight.
- `/lossless doctor apply confirm-offline` overrides that preflight for the current conversation after its active channel path has been isolated.
- `/lossless doctor apply <conversation-id> confirm-offline` targets a specific conversation, including an archived or non-current conversation. Targeted repair always requires the explicit offline confirmation.

Conversation ids are gateway-wide maintenance identifiers rather than sender ownership credentials. Only authorized OpenClaw command senders can invoke the command; before targeting an id, pause or move active delivery away from that conversation and verify the displayed session key is the intended lane.

### `/lossless doctor clean`

Use this when the user wants read-only diagnostics for high-confidence junk patterns before any cleanup.

It should help confirm:

- whether archived subagent sessions are present under any configured OpenClaw agent id
- whether cron sessions are accumulating unexpectedly under any configured OpenClaw agent id
- whether NULL-key orphaned subagent conversations are present
- which high-confidence filters match the most conversations and messages

This command is read-only. Use it to identify likely cleanup candidates before taking any separate cleanup action.
Its keyed-session filters require an exact configured agent-id segment, an exact `cron` or `subagent` lane segment, and a non-empty lane suffix.

## Interpreting common states

### `/lossless` tokens vs `/status` context

These numbers are related, but they are not the same metric.

- `/lossless` reports LCM-side conversation metrics such as the current frontier token count and compression ratio.
- `/status` reports the last assembled runtime prompt snapshot for the active model.

Why they can differ:

- runtime assembly can trim or omit frontier material before the request is sent
- model-specific token budgeting and packing happen after LCM frontier selection
- `/status` reflects a last-run snapshot, while `/lossless` reads live LCM state from the DB

Treat `/lossless` as the LCM health/shape view, and `/status` as the runtime request view.

### No summaries yet

Usually means one of:

- the conversation has not crossed compaction thresholds yet
- the plugin is not selected as the context engine
- writes are being skipped because the session matches stateless or ignored patterns

### DB exists but stays tiny

Usually means one of:

- the plugin is not receiving traffic
- the wrong DB path is configured
- the plugin is enabled but not selected

### Broken or truncated summaries detected

Treat this as a signal to inspect summary health before trusting compacted context heavily.

For MVP guidance:

- keep the user on `/lossless doctor`
- explain the count and affected conversations
- avoid advertising separate repair-vs-doctor command families

## Safe operator advice

- Do not guess exact historical details from compacted context alone.
- When a user wants a fact pattern verified, use recall tools to recover evidence.
- Prefer changing one configuration knob at a time and then re-checking `/lossless`.
- Never use the offline maintenance drain on an active conversation; pause or move delivery first and rely on the command's final queued inactivity check as a race guard, not as the initial isolation step.
